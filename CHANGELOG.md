## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

* cTAKES XMI output produces duplicate CUIs due to different codes; by default, only take the first now to more accurately represent CUI count

### Added

* Function/script to generate comparisons between different methods/approaches using Jaccard similarity


## [1.0.1] - 2024-10-16

### Fixed

* Error was raised when parsing cTAKES xmi files when the entity is not one of the target CUIs


## [1.0.0] - 2024-09-20

### Added

* Improved documentation, especially PheNorm example implementation of Anaphylaxis

### Fixed

* Ensured that `cuis_by_doc` output file contains all target CUIs from the CUI file



## [0.5.0] - 2024-08-16

### Added

* `--note-suffix` and `--output-suffix` if suffixes are different than those required (experimental)
* CUI normalization
* Documentation/docstrings including for PheNorm-specific use cases
* Improved logging with suggested troubleshooting methods
* Added support for SAS7BDAT files as an input corpus
* Extract MDR (MedDRA) LLTs (lower level terms) for a given set of PTs (primary terms)
* Always add newline when creating files for compatibility with MetaMap (tests fixed too)

### Fixed

* Skipping non-strings and empty notes when converting a corpus to files
* Click parameters not being accepted by function in `mml-extract-mml` function 



## [0.4.0] - 2023-12-19

### Added

* `pandas` as required rather than optional
* Generate pivot table when running `extract_mml` to show CUI counts note
* Documentation on using Metamap
* Timestamp to `cuis_by_doc` CSV output
* Added `cuis_by_doc.mmi.csv` as an example (this is referenced by the documentation)
* Tests for the complete examples in `./examples/complete` to ensure these work as expected

### Fixed

* Remove duplicate test
* `mml-extract-mml` was crashing on json input, so create default TargetCuis for json (already there in mmi)


## [0.3.6] - 2023-11-16

### Added

* Specify directory or file for `run_mml_filelist`
* Escapes for spaces and parens when building scripts
* Including a `start-servers` script as a reminder to kick-off required MM services
* Clean file ensures newline at end of each file (required by MM)

### Fixed

* Allow *.txt suffix when scanning for files


## [0.3.5] - 2023-09-28

### Added

- Enable multi-metamap builder to make replacements to the source posix path.
- All cui file to do transformations.
- Script to transform file from UTF-8 (or other encoding) to ASCII.

### Fixed

- Posix can't have quotes in the classpath when supplying argument to MM


## [0.3.4] - 2023-06-07

### Added

- Added logging
- Gave option to specify a max number of knowledge base articles (not just a min)
- Scripts to build metamap shell scripts by varying parameters, etc.
- Metamap shell script builder now generates a draft AFEP toml config
- more AFEP configs can be grouped in MultiAfepConfig to reduce amount of redundant configurations
- Updated README with new metamap script builder commands
- Can specify file or directory when running mml, and a filelist will automatically be created

### Fixed

- Fixed bug when running AFEP with a single set of data.
- Force Excel summary tab name length to be <= 31.


## [0.3.3] - 2023-05-25

### Changed

- Remove default UMLS version/dataset from `run_mml` and allow these as specified by parameters
  - If nothing specified, default to looking up available datasets, defaulting to `USAbase` dataset


## [0.3.2] - 2023-05-24

### Added

- Using `charset_normalizer` package to read files correctly (with file encoding) before splitting. This should probably be used more broadly...eventually.


## [0.3.1] - 2023-05-23

### Added

- Check for MMI in second field earlier in the process (to avoid parsing failures)
- Run Metamaplite on a single file rather than requiring a filelist

- Test for building AFEP summary table
- Added documentation for AFEP commands

- Doco for installing/using metamap
- Add `all_semantictypes` and `all_sources` to mmi output
- Skip metamap acronym/abbreviation lines
- Change `min_kb` to allow setting globally in `run_afep_multi`

### Fixed

- Random requires `list`, not `set`
- Updated `pyproject.toml` for new flit version
- Migrated `pytest_lazy_fixture` to new format (i.e., no longer able to call from pytest directly) 
- Changed mmi parser to handle commas/semicolons more appropriately

## [0.2.3]

### Added

- Updated AFEP process to include reading from cTAKES (requires specifying the `--data-directory` option)
