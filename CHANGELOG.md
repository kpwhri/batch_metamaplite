- Scripts to build metamap shell scripts by varying parameters, etc.
- Metamap shell script builder now generates a draft AFEP toml config
- more AFEP configs can be grouped in MultiAfepConfig to reduce amount of redundant configuartions

- Remove default UMLS version/dataset from `run_mml` and allow these as specified by parameters
  - If nothing specified, default to looking up available datasets, defaulting to `USAbase` dataset

## [0.3.2] - 2023-05-24

### Added

- Using `charset_normalizer` package to read files correctly (with file encoding) before splitting. This should probably be used more broadly...eventually.


## [0.3.1] - 2023-05-23

### Added

- Check for MMI in second field earlier in the process (to avoid parsing failures)
- Run Metamaplite on a single file rather than requiring a filelist

- Console scripts to `pyproject.toml` for new functionality
- Test for building AFEP summary table
- Added documentation for AFEP commands

- Doco for installing/using metamap
- Add `all_semantictypes` and `all_sources` to mmi output
- Skip metamap acronym/abbreviation lines
- Change `min_kb` to allow setting globally in `run_afep_multi`

### Fixed

- Random requires `list`, not `set`
- Updated `pyproject.toml` for new flit version
