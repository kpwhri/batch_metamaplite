    ```

## Data Formats

| Tool        | Encoding | Requires Newline | Allows Spaces in Path | Must Run in Text Directory |
|-------------|----------|------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|
| Metamap     | ?        | : Y            : | : N:                  | :N:                        |
| Metamaplite | ?        | : N            : | : N:                  | :Y:                        |
| cTAKES      | ?        | : N            : | : Y:                  | :Y:                        |

## Usage

### End-to-End Example

In the `examples/complete/` directory, you can find a complete end-to-end example of build and running MetaMapLite. One
using `*.json` and the other `*.mmi` formats.

Please see [README.md](examples/complete/README.md) file there for step-by-step instructions.

This examples will lead you through:

* Installing metamaplite (MML)
* Installing this package
* Running MML on a sample CSV dataset
* Extracting results
* Generating frequency tables

### Data Preparation

#### Corpus

Apart from just installing the code, you'll need to prepare and format your data. This can often be quite
time-consuming as you'll need to select a cohort, time windows, etc.
Prepare this data to look like the [corpus.csv file](examples/complete/corpus.csv) with columns of:

* `studyid`
* `docid`
* `text`

Also, create a `metadata_file.csv` which contains:

* `studyid`
* `docid`
* `date`: as `YYYY-MM-DD`
* ...other fields which may be of interest.

For MetaMapLite (MML) to read the data, you'll need all the text in a single directory.
The name of each note should be `DOCID.txt` (Python: `f'{docid}.txt'`).
See the [end-to-end examples](examples/complete/README.md) for commands to convert
[CSV to Text](examples/complete/README.md#csv-to-text) and
[creating filelists](examples/complete/README.md#aside-split-into-multiple-filelists).

#### Supplementary Files

In addition to the corpus files, several JSON files can be useful for summarizing data (building frequencies, etc.).

##### CUI Definitions

A CUI Definitions json file can be constructed defining the different CUIs that are be targeted.
This is particularly useful when building frequency files
([`mml-build-freqs` command](examples/complete/README.md#generate-frequency-tables)).

By compiling a list of CUIs in a txt file, this file can be built automatically with a script from the
[`umls_api_tool` package](https://github.com/dcronkite/umls_api_tool/blob/master/examples/cui/cui_to_best_definition.py).

Here's an example:

```json
[
  {
    "cui": "C0027497",
    "definition": "Nausea"
  },
  {
    "cui": "C0027498",
    "definition": "Nausea and vomiting"
  }
]
```

##### Feature Mapping

In certain applications, multiple CUIs will be grouped into a single *feature* or *category*.
A JSON file should be generated grouping these together. CUIs may appear in multiple features.

Mapping of `feature_name` -> `CUIs`. This will be a json file like:

```json
[
  {
    "feature": "Nausea",
    "cuis": [
      "C0027498",
      "C0027497"
    ]
  },
  {
    "feature": "Vomiting",
    "cuis": [
      "C0027498",
      "C0221151",
      "C1510416",
      "C0152165",
      "C0020450",
      "C0042963"
    ]
  },
  {
    "feature": "Diarrhea",
    "cuis": [
      "C0011991"
    ]
  }
]
```

### Run Metamaplite in Batches

These scripts assume the following use case:

* Files are currently being written/built to the target directory.
* You want to start running Metamaplite on those records that have already been written
* The total number of files can be unknown.

These scripts will repeatedly look for new files, build filelists, and run Metamaplite.

#### mml-to-txt

Prepare files for running metamaplite. Files can be in CSV file or SQL database.

Additional Options (for both sql/csv):

* `--n-dirs [INTEGER]`
    * Number of directories to create with text files. Defaults to 1
* `--text-encoding utf8`
    * If you want the files in an encoding other than `utf8`, please specify. Be sure to test what MetaMapLite is able
      to handle.
* `--text-extension ".txt"`
    * Another option is to have no extension for these files. In that case, specify an empty string.

##### mml-sql-to-txt

For SQL, you will need to install `sqlalchemy` and a driver (e.g., `pyodbc` for SQL Server as in the example below).

* `pip install sqlalchemy pyodbc`

The first two arguments are the SqlAlchemy-style connection string, followed by the query to retrieve (note_id, text).

Example:

    mml-sql-to-txt "mssql+pyodbc://SERVER/DATABASE?driver=SQL+Server" "select note_id, note_text from corpus" --outdir OUTDIR

##### mml-csv-to-txt

For CSV, you will need to specify the id and text columns.

Example:

    mml-csv-to-txt /path/to/corpus.csv --outdir OUTDIR --id-col note_id --text-col note_text

#### mml-build-filelists

Prepare files for running metamaplite.

Take a directory with text documents (input files for metamaplite), organize them into groups of 100.000 for subsequent
processing. The subsequent processing will be done by related `mml-run-filelists-dir` command.

Arguments:

    * --outpath OUTPATH
        - This is more of a workspace. Input documents are expected under `outpath`/clarity.
        - Target files (text documents) will be moved from `clarity` to `mml`
        - Files with groups of 100.000 text documents will be plaaced in `mml_lists` subdirectory.

Example:

    mml-build-filelists --outpath /path/to/dir
        - /path/to/dir
            - clarity [assumes exists with text documents]
                - 001.txt
                - 002.txt
                - etc.
            - mml [starts empty; text documents will be moved here]
                - 001.txt
                - 002.txt
                - etc.
            - mml_lists [starts empty; lists of files in `mml` directory will be placed here
                - files_[date].in_progress  [100.000 references to `mml` directory; ready for processing]
                - files_[date].in_progress  [100.000 references to `mml` directory; ready for processing]
                - files_[date].building  [currently being built; don't process]

After, run `mml-run-filelists-dir` to process all these files. Their extension will be changed to `.complete`.

#### mml-run-filelists-dir

Run metamaplite from `mml_lists` and `mml` directory created by `build_filelists.py`.

Arguments:

    * --mml-home PATH
        - Path to install directory of Metamaplite. This will be placed as path to executable.

    * --filedir PATH
        - Path to mml_lists directory (output from `build_filelists.py`).
        - Must choose one of the numbered outputs.
        - Will only process current `in_progress` (reads at initialization; doesn't keep checking for new files)

Example:

    mml-run-filelists-dir --mml-home ./public_mm_lite --filedir /path/to/dir/mml_lists/0

### mml-copy-notes

Copy files from a completed MML directory to a new one to re-run MML.

Metamaplite dumps the output `*.json` files in the same directory. If you want to rerun MML, either the `*.json` files
or the notes need to be moved. This script will move the notes.

Assumptions:

* All notes have no extension.
    * To do this would require adding `Path.glob(*.txt)`, which might be a future change.

  mml-copy-notes --source /path/to/notes --dest /path/to/notes2

### mml-run-filelist

Run metamaplite against a single filelist. This has the advantage of automatically re-running if a file causes an
error (and skipping it in the next run).

Each run will result in a newly-created filelist version. Default output format is `json`.

    mml-run-filelist --filelist /path/to/filelist.txt --mml-home ./public_mm_lite [--output-format (mmi|json)]

### mml-extract-mml

Extract results from running Metamaplite. Currently supports json (default), xmi (ctakes), and mmi. This command assumes that the mmi/json files from Metamaplite are on the same path as the text files/notes. If this is not the case, specify the path to the text files/notes in `/path/to/notes` and use `--output-directory` to specify where the output files are.

*Important assumptions about extensions:* ideally the extensions to all text files will be `.txt` (or no extension) and those to the output formats for for Metamaplite/cTAKES are `.mmi`, `.json`, or `.txt.xmi`. If this is not the case, you can try the experimental `--output-suffix` and `--notes-suffix` (if not `.txt`). In addition, the *stem* of both the note and the relevant output file must be identical. If possible, use only a single `.` (period, dot) in the filename (i.e., prefer not using multiple suffixes).

    mml-extract-mml /path/to/notes [/path/to/notes2] --outdir /path/to/output --cui-file /only/include/these/cuis.txt [--output-format (mmi|json|xmi)]

For usage with cTAKES output, include the `--output-directory [CTAKES_XMI_DIR]` which points to the cTAKES output
directory.

    mml-extract-mml /path/to/notes --outdir /path/to/output [...] --output-directory /path/to/*.xmi.txt_dir --output-format xmi

For encoding challenges, you can use the following arguments:

* `--file-encoding`: encoding that the text notes are written/saved in (e.g., 'latin1', 'utf8')
* `--output-encoding`: encoding that the program (i.e., Metamaplite or cTAKES) wrote the output to

#### mml-compare-extracts

To compare two different feature extraction processes (e.g., cTAKES + MedDRA vs MML + MedDRA), place the
relevant `notes` and `mml` csv files into directories named after the feature extraction. This command is
directory-based rather than file-based, so both outputs cannot be in the same folder. For the following example (
generated from `mml-extract-mml`...

    ct_meddra / notes_20230329.csv
    ct_meddra / mml_20230329.csv
    mml_meddra / notes_20230329.csv
    mml_meddra / mml_20230329.csv

...use this command:

    mml-compare-extracts ct_meddra mml_meddra

This will create a comparison CSV file called 'compare_ct_meddra_mml_meddra.csv' in the current directory showing the
differences.

More generally, the command:

    mml-compare-extracts EXTRACT_DIR_1 EXTRACT_DIR_2 [--outpath OUTPUT_DIR] [--text-encoding (utf|latin1|etc.)] [--name1 NAME] [--name2 NAME2]

The `--name#` arguments are to override the default names which are based on the directories.

### mml-check-progress

Check progress of Metamaplite running in a single directory.

    mml-check-progress /path/to/notes

To enable repeatedly checking, e.g., every 24 hours (and outputting results to log):

    mml-check-progress /path/to/notes --repeat-hours 24

To have the process stop before a certain date or after a certain number of hours, use either of these:

    mml-check-progress /path/to/notes --repeat-end-after-hours 168   # 1 week
    mml-check-progress /path/to/notes --repeat-end-after-datetime 2030-01-01   # will not run after this time

### mml-split-filelist

Split a filelist into multiple parts (to allow for parallelizing MML).

This command will generate 3 separate files (`filelist.txt_part0`, `filelist.txt_part1`, and `filelist.txt_part2`), each
containing 1/3. (`partN` will contain lines where `line_number % 3 == N`.)

    mml-split-filelist filelist.txt 3

Each of these output files can be fed separately into [`mml-run-filelist`](#mml-run-filelist)

### mml-split-files

Some files are too long for MML to properly parse (at least in a reasonable amount of time). This script will split the
long file into ones of (by default) 200 lines, adding all the resulting files to a new `filelist.txt`.

    mml-split-files Medscape.txt Wikipedia.txt [--n-lines 200] [--filelist filelist.txt] 

Or, you can specify an entire directory with files as below:

    mml-split-files kb-articles [--n-lines 200]

This will produce files like this:

* Medscape_0.txt
* Medscape_1.txt
* Medscape_n.txt
* Wikipedia_0.txt
* Wikipedia_1.txt
* Wikipedia_n.txt
* filelist.txt  <- Run this file using [`mml-run-filelist`](#mml-run-filelist).

### mml-run-afep

This is not directly related to MML. If, however, you want to implement AFEP, this and
the [previous section](#mml-split-files) may be of some use.

1. Download text from Knowledge Base sources (e.g., Medline, Medscape, Merck, Wikipedia, Mayo) on your target
   condition (e.g., arthritis or COVID-19).
2. Name these text files something like 'Medscape.txt' and 'Wikipedia.txt' and place them in a new directory (
   e.g., `/kb_articles/`).
3. Split the files into no more than say 200 lines (see [mml-split-files](#mml-split-files) command for assistance).
4. Run MML on the entire directory (e.g., `/kb_articles/`).
5. Run [mml-run-afep](#mml-run-afep) on the output (see parametrisation below).

As a prerequisite, you'll need to install pandas (`pip install pandas`) which is not installed by default due to this
being the only script requiring it.

    mml-run-afep /kb_articles/ [--mml-format json|mmi] [--outdir .]

An Excel table showing the resulting CUIs can then be built by running:

    mml-summarize-afep OUTDIR(outdirectory from `mml-run-afep` command)

If experimenting with multiple approaches (e.g., cTAKES+MedDRA vs MML+MedDRA vs ...), you can run these all in a single
command:

    mml-run-afep-multi config.toml

Example TOML (an example can be generated using `write_afep_script_for_dirs`):

    outdir = 'path/output_dir'
    
    [[runs]]
    note_directories = ['/path/to/usabase']
    
    [[runs]]
    note_directories = ['/path/to/meddra']
    name = 'mdr'  # use 'mdr' as output name rather than 'meddra'
    
    [[runs]]
    note_directories = ['/path/to/kb_articles']
    data_directory = ['/path/to/ctakes_meddra']
    expand_cuis = True
    apikey = '1234-5678-9101'

This will run AFEP three times and then create an Excel file containing the summary measures.

### Build Metamap Scripts: mml-build-mmscript / mml-build-mmscript-multi

Build a metamap shell script can be a bit of a challenge since the metamap executable expects specifying only a single
target file and a single output file. Instead of building this manually, `mml-build-mmscript` (for single
configurations) and `mml-build-mmscript-multi` (for comparing multiple metamap configurations).

An example config using the `mml-build-mmscript-multi`:

    outpath = 'C:/metamap/scripts'
    filelist = 'C:/metamap/kb_filelist.txt'
    mm_outpath = '/mnt/c/output'
    parameters = '-R MDR,RXNORM -Z 2022AB -V NLM -N'  # shared parameters, will be prefixed
    
    [[runs]]
    # the first run with unique metamap parameters
    parameters = '-y -C --conj'
    name = 'relaxed_wsd_conj'
    
    [[runs]]
    # another configuration
    parameters = '-y -C'
    name = 'relaxed_wsd'
    
    [[runs]]
    parameters = '-C --conj'
    name = 'conj'

### mml-check-offsets

Confirm that the offsets reported by MML are correct.

    mml-check-offsets /path/to/notes

If running MML on Windows, include `--add-cr` to add back carriage returns.

Use `--replacements old==new` to make certain changes to 'fix' the matches (e.g., special characters).

### mml-prepare-review

Prepare review lists of CSV files.

Inputs (see `tests/fever` for examples:

* Text file (`feature.cui.txt`) containing target CUIs, 1 per line
* String file (`feature.string.txt`) containing text strings to look for and include with CUI data

  mml-prepare-review /path/to/notes --target-path
  /path/to/inputs [--mml-format json] [--text-extension .txt] [--text-encoding utf8]

To then take samples from this dataset, use `mml-prepare-review-sample`.

## Troubleshooting

* If there is a problem with file encoding (e.g., an error like 'unable to decode byte'), the above programs should
  provide some method for specifying the encoding:
    * Example options: `--text-encoding` / `--file-encoding`, `--output-encoding`
    * Example encodings to try for English: `utf8`, `latin1`
