## About the Project 
The goal of this project is to put together various scripts to handle the preparation, running, and post-run extraction of results from Metamaplite.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.9+
* pip install .
  * See pyproject.toml for updated dependencies.

### Installation

0. Setup a virtual environment 
    ```shell
    python -m venv .venv 
    ```
1. Clone the repo
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/kpwhri/batch_metamaplite.git
    ```
2. Install the package (using pyproject.toml)
    ```sh
    pip install .
    ```

## Usage


### Run Metamaplite in Batches

These scripts assume the following use case:
* Files are currently being written/built to the target directory.
* You want to start running Metamaplite on those records that have already been written
* The total number of files can be unknown.

These scripts will repeatedly look for new files, build filelists, and run Metamaplite.

#### mml-build-filelists
Prepare files for running metamaplite.

Take a directory with text documents (input files for metamaplite), organize them into groups of 100.000
    for subsequent processing. The subsequent processing will be done by related `mml-run-filelists-dir` command.

Arguments:

    * --outpath OUTPATH
        - This is more of a workspace. Input documents are expected under `outpath`/clarity.
        - Target files (text documents) will be moved from `clarity` to `mml`
        - Files with groups of 100.000 text documents will be plaaced in `mml_lists` subdirectory.


Example:

    mml-build-filelists --outpath /path/to/dir
        - /path/to/dir
            - clarity [assumes exists with text documents]
                - 001.txt
                - 002.txt
                - etc.
            - mml [starts empty; text documents will be moved here]
                - 001.txt
                - 002.txt
                - etc.
            - mml_lists [starts empty; lists of files in `mml` directory will be placed here
                - files_[date].in_progress  [100.000 references to `mml` directory; ready for processing]
                - files_[date].in_progress  [100.000 references to `mml` directory; ready for processing]
                - files_[date].building  [currently being built; don't process]

After, run `mml-run-filelists-dir` to process all these files. Their extension will be changed to `.complete`.

#### mml-run-filelists-dir
Run metamaplite from `mml_lists` and `mml` directory created by `build_filelists.py`.


Arguments:

    * --mml-home PATH
        - Path to install directory of Metamaplite. This will be placed as path to executable.

    * --filedir PATH
        - Path to mml_lists directory (output from `build_filelists.py`).
        - Must choose one of the numbered outputs.
        - Will only process current `in_progress` (reads at initialization; doesn't keep checking for new files)

Example:

    mml-run-filelists-dir --mml-home ./public_mm_lite --filedir /path/to/dir/mml_lists/0


### mml-copy-notes
Copy files from a completed MML directory to a new one to re-run MML.

Metamaplite dumps the output `*.json` files in the same directory. If you want to rerun MML, either the `*.json` files or the notes need to be moved. This script will move the notes.

Assumptions:
* All notes have no extension.
  * To do this would require adding `Path.glob(*.txt)`, which might be a future change.


    mml-copy-notes --source /path/to/notes --dest /path/to/notes2


### mml-run-filelist

Run metamaplite against a single filelist. This has the advantage of automatically re-running if a file causes an error (and skipping it in the next run).

Each run will result in a newly-created filelist version.

    
    mml-run-filelist --filelist /path/to/filelist.txt --mml-home ./public_mm_lite


### mml-extract-mml

Extract results from running Metamaplite. Currently only supports json output.


    mml-extract-mml /path/to/notes [/path/to/notes2] --outdir /path/to/output --cui-file /only/include/these/cuis.txt


### mml-check-progress

Check progress of Metamaplite running in a single directory.


    mml-check-progress /path/to/notes

To enable repeatedly checking, e.g., every 24 hours (and outputting results to log):

    mml-check-progress /path/to/notes --repeat-hours 24

To have the process stop before a certain date or after a certain number of hours, use either of these:

    mml-check-progress /path/to/notes --repeat-end-after-hours 168   # 1 week
    mml-check-progress /path/to/notes --repeat-end-after-datetime 2030-01-01   # will not run after this time


### mml-split-filelist

Split a filelist into multiple parts (to allow for parallelizing MML).

This command will generate 3 separate files (`filelist.txt_part0`, `filelist.txt_part1`, and `filelist.txt_part2`), each containing 1/3. (`partN` will contain lines where `line_number % 3 == N`.)

    mml-split-filelist filelist.txt 3

Each of these output files can be fed separately into [`mml-run-filelist`](#mml-run-filelist)
