## UMLS Dataset Levels

The UMLS datasets are divided into various levels. These can be browsed [here](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/sourcereleasedocs/index.html).

### MetaMapLite
By default, MetaMapLite comes bundled with `0+4+9` (i.e., all of the vocabularies from Levels 0, 4, and 9).

One quite useful vocabulary that is omitted from MetaMapLite is the level 3 vocabulary `MedDRA` (*Medical Dictionary for Regular Activities*).
 This dictionary includes terminology related to 'medical products'.
