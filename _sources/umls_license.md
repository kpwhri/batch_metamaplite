2. By doing this, you will agree to the UMLS License: https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/uts/assets/LicenseAgreement.pdf
3. To keep your account current (i.e., to keep being able to use it), you will need to annually complete a survey
   describing which sources, etc., you used, along with any suggestions for improvements.
