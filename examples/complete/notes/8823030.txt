Pancreatitis is a disease in which your pancreas becomes inflamed.

The pancreas is a large gland behind your stomach and next to your small intestine. Your pancreas does two main things:

It releases powerful digestive enzymes into your small intestine to help you digest food.
It releases insulin and glucagon into your bloodstream. These hormones help your body control how it uses food for energy.
Your pancreas can be damaged when digestive enzymes begin working before your pancreas releases them.

The two forms of pancreatitis are acute and chronic.

Acute pancreatitis is sudden inflammation that lasts a short time. It can range from mild discomfort to a severe, life-threatening illness. Most people with acute pancreatitis recover completely after getting the right treatment. In severe cases, acute pancreatitis can cause bleeding, serious tissue damage, infection, and cysts. Severe pancreatitis can also harm other vital organs such as the heart, lungs, and kidneys.
Chronic pancreatitis is long-lasting inflammation. It most often happens after an episode of acute pancreatitis. Another top cause is drinking lots of alcohol for a long period of time. Damage to your pancreas from heavy alcohol use may not cause symptoms for many years, but then you may suddenly have severe pancreatitis symptoms.
